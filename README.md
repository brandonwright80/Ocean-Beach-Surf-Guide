## 📌 Main Variables That Impact Surf Conditions

### 1. Swell Height
- How big the waves are (e.g., 3 ft, 6 ft, 10 ft).
- **Ocean Beach gets powerful quickly**, so 3–6 ft is usually manageable.
- Over 8–10 ft becomes expert-only.

### 2. Swell Period
- Time between waves (measured in seconds).
- Longer period = more powerful waves.
- 12–16 seconds is common for good surf.

### 3. Swell Direction
- Shows where the waves come from (NW, W, SW).
- Ocean Beach works best with:
  - **NW or WNW** swells in winter
  - **SW** swells in spring/summer

### 4. Wind Speed & Direction
- Wind can make waves clean or messy.
- Best: **Light offshore wind** (E or NE).
- Worst: **Strong onshore wind** turning waves choppy.

### 5. Tide
- Ocean Beach changes a lot with tides.
- Mid tide often best for shape.
- Very high tide can make waves soft.
- Very low tide can expose strong currents.

### 6. Water Temperature
- Typically 50–57°F most of the year.
- Wetsuit required.
