## Fascinating Ocean Beach History

- **Ocean Beach used to have amusement parks 🎡**  
  In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were roller coasters, baths, and attractions right by the ocean.

- **Ocean Beach is always changing shape 🌊**  
  Winter storms can remove large amounts of sand, and summer waves often bring it back.

- **Ocean Beach runs about 3.5 miles along San Francisco’s west side 🚴**  
  The Great Highway follows the coastline from Cliff House to Fort Funston.
