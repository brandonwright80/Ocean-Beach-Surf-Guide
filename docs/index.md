Hi, I’m Brandon, a surfer building a beginner-friendly guide to help others understand what drives surf conditions at Ocean Beach, San Francisco.

Fascinating Ocean Beach History
1) Ocean Beach used to have amusement parks 🎡
    - In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were roller coasters, baths, and attractions right by the ocean.
2) Ocean Beach is always changing shape 🌊
    - Winter storms can remove large amounts of sand, and summer waves often bring it back.
3) Runs for about 3.5 miles along San Francisco’s west side, with the Great Highway following the coastline from Cliff House to Fort Funston.
